# Data-Science, Machine Learning & Deep Learning Models  
A collection of data-science, machine-learning, and deep-learning example notebooks / implementations in Python / Jupyter.

## 📖 Overview  
This repository contains a wide variety of data-analysis, machine-learning, and deep-learning notebooks — covering classical ML, statistical testing, time-series, NLP, recommendation systems, and more.  
It serves as a learning sandbox / reference library: you can directly run the notebooks, inspect the code, and use them as starting points for your own data-science / ML projects.

## ✨ What’s Inside / Key Features  

| Area / Topic | Description / What to learn / Use-case |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| Basics & Data Structures | Foundational Python / data-handling basics |
| Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) | Notebooks covering data cleaning, visualization, preliminary analysis |
| Statistical Testing & Classical Statistics | Hypothesis testing, basic statistics, statistical analysis workflows |
| Supervised Learning (Regression & Classification) | Multiple Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost / LightGBM, etc. |
| Unsupervised Learning / Dimensionality Reduction / Clustering / PCA | Clustering, PCA, feature reduction, unsupervised workflows |
| Time-Series Forecasting | Examples showing forecasting workflows using time-series data |
| Recommendation Systems | Example implementations of recommendation-system logic |
| Natural Language Processing (NLP) & Sentiment Analysis | Text processing, NLP pipelines, sentiment analysis examples |
| Neural Networks & Deep Learning Models | Vanilla neural nets, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), basic deep-learning examples |

## 🚀 Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
You should have Python installed (preferably via Anaconda / conda) or a working Jupyter / IPython environment.  
You may need the following (or similar) libraries/packages: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib / seaborn, possibly deep-learning libraries (depending on notebooks).  

### Installation  

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Kiran-id10/data-science-machine-learning-and-deep-learning-models.git

# Change to project directory  
cd data-science-machine-learning-and-deep-learning-models

# (Optional) create a virtual environment  
python -m venv venv  
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies  
# Example (if you have requirements.txt)  
pip install -r requirements.txt
